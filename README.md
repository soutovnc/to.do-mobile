  🎯 About Challenge 
</h3>

In this challenge, I will develop a task control application. An **to do list**, with the following functionalities:

- [x] add a new task
- [x] remove a task from the list
- [x] mark and unmark a task as completed or not

Even though there were few features, I practiced concepts such as:

- state management
- immutability of state
- lists and keys in react native
- properties
- componentization
- Async storage

  💻 Technologies & Layout

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

And the result achieved was:

  <img alt="Task list void" src="./src/assets/task-list-void.png" width="25%" />
  <img alt="Task list" src="./src/assets/task-list.png" width="25%" />
</p>

## :gear: If you want testing

```bash
### after clone repo, install the dependencies
$ npm i

### running application
$ npm run start

### If you can use a emulator, write "a" in terminal to run android emulator
### or use your device and scan the QRcode on terminal
```
See you later, bye 👋🏻!
